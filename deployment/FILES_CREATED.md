aws configure
# Enter Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, region (ap-south-1)

# Generate SSH keys
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa -N ""
```

### 2. **Customize Configuration**
```bash

cd terraform
terraform init
terraform plan -out=tfplan
terraform apply tfplan

# Wait 3-5 minutes...
# Copy the instance IP from output
```

### 4. **Update Ansible**
```bash
# Edit ansible/inventory.ini
# Replace IP address with your instance IP

# Edit ansible/playbook.yml (if not done)
# - repo_url: your GitHub URL
# - domain_name: your domain
```

### 5. **Deploy Application**

### Scale to Multiple Instances
Edit `terraform/terraform.tfvars`:
```hcl
instance_count = 3  # Creates 3 instances instead of 1
```

### Increase Performance
Edit `terraform/terraform.tfvars`:
```hcl
instance_type = "t3.small"  # More CPU and RAM
instance_type = "t3.medium"  # Even more power
```
