## ✅ Deployment Checklist

### Before Deployment
- [ ] AWS account created
- [ ] AWS Access Keys generated
- [ ] AWS CLI configured (`aws configure`)
- [ ] Terraform installed
- [ ] Ansible installed
- [ ] SSH key pair generated
- [ ] Read at least QUICK_START.md

### Configuration
- [ ] Edit `terraform/terraform.tfvars`
- [ ] Customize AWS region if needed
- [ ] Update `ansible/inventory.ini` (after Terraform creates instance)
- [ ] Update `ansible/playbook.yml` with GitHub repo URL

### Deployment
- [ ] Run `terraform init`
- [ ] Run `terraform plan`
- [ ] Review plan output
- [ ] Run `terraform apply`
- [ ] Wait 3-5 minutes for instance
- [ ] Copy instance IP to Ansible inventory
- [ ] Wait 2-3 minutes for SSH to be ready
- [ ] Run `ansible-playbook playbook.yml -v`
- [ ] Wait 10-15 minutes for configuration
- [ ] Open browser and test: `http://INSTANCE_IP`

### Post-Deployment
- [ ] Verify app is running
- [ ] Check logs for errors
- [ ] Setup custom domain (optional)
- [ ] Configure SSL/HTTPS (automatic if domain set)
- [ ] Setup monitoring
- [ ] Plan backup strategy

## 💡 Key Concepts

### **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
Your infrastructure is defined in files (terraform/main.tf)
- Reproducible
- Version controlled
- Documented
- Testable before applying

### **Configuration Management**
Your server configuration is defined in files (ansible/playbook.yml)
- Automated setup
- No manual steps
- Repeatable
- Documented

### **Terraform**
Provisions cloud resources:
```
Terraform (define) → AWS API → Infrastructure created
```

### **Ansible**
Configures servers:
```
Ansible (define) → SSH → Server configured
```

### **Together**
```
Write Code → Terraform Creates → Ansible Configures → App Running
```

## 💰 Cost Estimates

### **Year 1 (Free Tier)**
- EC2 t3.micro: $0
- Data transfer: $0
- IP address: $0
- **Total: $0**

### **Year 2+ (After Free Tier)**
- EC2 t3.micro: ~$9/month = $108/year
- Data transfer: ~$0.10/month = $1.20/year
- **Total: ~$110/year or $9/month**

### **Comparison**
- Manual shared hosting: $2-5/month
- Heroku: $7/month (after free tier)
- DigitalOcean: $5/month
- **Our AWS setup: $9/month (industry standard, scalable)**

## 🔒 Security Highlights

✅ Firewall (UFW) - only open necessary ports
✅ SSH key authentication - no passwords
✅ SSL/HTTPS - Let's Encrypt (automatic, free)
✅ IAM roles - minimal permissions
✅ Security groups - network firewall
✅ Process auto-restart - no downtime
✅ Log rotation - prevent disk space issues
✅ Regular updates - security patches

---

## 🚀 Next Steps After Deployment

1. **Custom Domain Setup** (Optional)
   - Point domain to Elastic IP
   - Run `sudo certbot --nginx -d yourdomain.com`

2. **Setup Monitoring**
   - CloudWatch (AWS built-in)
   - Or Datadog/New Relic

3. **Automate Backups**
   - Database backups
   - Configuration backups

4. **Setup CI/CD** (Advanced)
   - GitHub Actions
   - Automated deployments

5. **Scale Your App** (When needed)
   - Add more instances
   - Setup load balancer
   - Use CloudFront CDN
